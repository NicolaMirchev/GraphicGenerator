        <p>
          The idea of the project came after the first week in university and
          the struggle to find the best combination for attending all the
          courses that I had been assigned for. The task is complex, because for
          each course there are few groups (in different time), which can be
          visited.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, many times the personal schedule, given to you from university,
          assigns two lectures (courses) in a single hour (e.g "Data structures"
          and "Data bases" at 13:30 on Monday). So, I decided to practice my
          skills with the technology I had been learning in this moment (Spring
          Boot), the ability to present the entities in the best possible way
          for the computer and to choose the best data structures and
          algorithms, so the project could give you the BEST SCHEDULE (with
          shortest gaps), based on given courses and options when to attend
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          What the program does is generating all possible combinations for
          attending the given courses and after that chooses the best option for
          the user (at this moment there are two options - less gaps, but more
          days at the univirsity, or bigger gap some day/s, but less days at
          university).

        <p>
          The first idea was only to exercise with Sping Boot and Spring Data
          JPA, so the back-end is Spring application, consisting of different
          packages- for cotrollers (REST API), services (where the algorithms
          about the combinations are executed) and percistance, where are the
          repositories, related to the data base. For development proccess I
          used postgres docker container. I made unit tests for each and after
          each service algorithm implementation, to be sure they work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to make some UI, where anyone could check their schedule and
          decided to practice with Angular, because I had previous experience. I
          decided that for the "first release" the project will be simpler and
          DB connection won't be necessary and the whole requiered data will be
          collected from the browser and sent at once through request. The
          application procceeds the data in the service layer and return a
          result which is based on the client browser collected data.

        <h4>Optimization</h4>
        <p>
          The entity model is more complex than the model used for this release
          and the algorithms use the complex model. This means that there is a
          conversion from one model to the other, before executing the
          algorithms, which slows down the proccess. The one solution that I
          have in mind is make the algorithms more generic and abstract. Another
          one is to migrate the model, when there are more complex features, so
          the more complex model could be used.
        </p>
        <h4>Features</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              See all possible combinations - This feature will be easy to
              implement, because to find the best schedule, there is already a
              written logic to generate all the combinations. But I am not sure
              if this feature will be useful, rather than confusing.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Login/Logout - respectively assign courses to given user (instead
              of the browser) - This feature will help me exercise with Spring
              Security, composition and relation between the objects in the
              application. The feature requires "login","logout", "my courses",
              "my schedule" views, so it will require more time to be
              implemented.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Better user experience on signing the courses. What will give a
              user better experince would be an option to select how many hours
              of the given course are requiered per week. Also, upload the data
              in some way, instead of writing it all by hand.
            </p>
