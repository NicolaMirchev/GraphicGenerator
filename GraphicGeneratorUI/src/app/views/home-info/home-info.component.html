        <p>
          The idea of the project came after first week in university and the
          struggle to find the best combination for attending all the courses
          that I had been assigned for. The complexity came, because for each
          course there are few groups(in different time), which can be visited.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, many times the personal schedule, given to you from university
          assign two lectures(courses) in a single hour (e.g "Data structures"
          and "Data bases" at 13:30 on Monday). So i decided to exercise with
          the technology I had been learning in this moment (Spring Boot), the
          ability to present the entities in the best possible way for the
          computer and to choose best data structures and algorithms, so the
          project could give you the BEST SCEDULE (with shortest gaps), based on
          given courses and options when to attend them.
        </p>
        <p>
          What the program does is generating all possible combinations for
          attending the given courses and after that chooses the best option for
          the user(at this moment there are two options - less gaps, but more
          days at the univirsity, or bigger gap some day/s, but less days at
          university).
